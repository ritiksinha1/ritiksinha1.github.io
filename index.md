# Select Projects
* **Ataxx** - Built this two-player strategy game and incorporated an AI using the mini-max algorithm for up to a depth of 5 moves.
* **Berkeley Housing Tool (React, Python, REST APIs)** - Helped create a web app that compiles apartment listings in Berkeley from different sources onto one website.
* **Convolve (C)** - Used OpenMP/OpenMPI to optimize matrix convolutions. Placed 9th place out of 400 submissions in my 61C class for best runtimes.


# Teaching
*   **Teaching Assistant:** I've been a TA for CS 61A (intro to CS class at Berkeley) for two semesters. I've also been a course tutor for Data 100.
*   **Computer Science Mentors:** I teach small supplementary sections for CS 61A. As a senior mentor, I've also trained small groups of new mentors.
*   **College Admissions Mentorship Program:** I'm the president of this club at UC Berkeley that volunteers to help local Berkeley high school students with the college admissions process. I've also taught the Education 197 decal course at UC Berkeley to help train our mentors. 
*   **Matriculate @ Berkeley:** I serve as a volunteer college counselor for high-achieving, low-income high school students around the nation. I've been proud to see my students matriculate to Cornell University, Florida University (full-ride), USC, and UC San Diego.
*   **Academic Intern**: I've been an academic intern for the CS 61A and Data 8 courses at UC Berkeley, where I've helped teach during the lab/discussion sections for these classes.
