# About Me
**Hello! I'm Ritik Sinha, a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science.**
Outside of coding, I also enjoy doing research, teaching CS classes at Berkeley, and mentoring high school students through the college application process.

# Select Projects
* **Ataxx (Java)** - Built this two-player strategy game and incorporated an AI using the mini-max algorithm for up to a depth of 5 moves.
* **Berkeley Housing Tool (React, Python, REST APIs)** - Helped create a web app that compiles apartment listings in Berkeley from different sources onto one website.
* **Convolve (C)** - Used OpenMP/OpenMPI to optimize matrix convolutions. Placed 9th place out of 400 submissions in my 61C class for best runtimes.
* **Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy Detector (Python, sci-kit learn, NumPy)** - Built a program to detect a rare sleep disorder based on an individual's sleep EEG waves as part of a research program at Boston University.


# Teaching
*   **Teaching Assistant:** I have been a TA for CS 61A (the intro to CS class at Berkeley) during Summer 2023 as well as a course tutor during Fall 2023.
*   **Computer Science Mentors:** I teach small supplementary sections for CS 61A. As a senior mentor, I've also trained small groups of new mentors.
*   **College Admissions Mentorship Program:** I'm the president of this club at UC Berkeley that volunteers to help local Berkeley high school students with the college admissions process. I've also taught the Education 197 decal course at UC Berkeley to help train our mentors. 
*   **Matriculate @ Berkeley:** I serve as a volunteer college counselor for high-achieving, low-income high school students around the nation. I was proud to see my students in this year's cohort matriculate to Cornell University and UC San Diego.
*   **Academic Intern**: I've been an academic intern for the CS 61A and Data 8 courses at UC Berkeley, where I've helped teach during the lab/discussion sections for these classes.
